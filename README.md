# Effcient Cut-finding in Hierarchical Gaussians Splatting

## Overview

This is the official implementation of our simulator, we wrapped the whole program into a module so that it can be called in `render_hierarchy.py` of [Hierarchical Gaussians Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/hierarchical-3d-gaussians/)

In order to view the design document, please refer to [this](./docs/spec.md).

## Roadmap

- [x] basic simulator code
- [x] incorporation into HGS code
- [x] updating structure figure
- [x] debugging
- [x] incorporation of weight-calculation process
- [x] add cycle count for return value
